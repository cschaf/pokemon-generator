## Project Description

This project is a feature-rich, web-based Pok√©mon Generator designed for fans and developers alike. It allows users to explore the world of Pok√©mon by generating customized lists based on a variety of criteria, including:

*   **Generation:** Select specific Pok√©mon generations (1-9).
*   **Type:** Filter by one or more of the 18 Pok√©mon types.
*   **Evolution:** Filter by position in the evolution chain (Basic, Stage 1, Stage 2) and the total length of the chain (1, 2, or 3 stages).
*   **Special Categories:** Include or exclude Legendary and Mythical Pok√©mon.

The application fetches Pok√©mon data and images dynamically from the PokeAPI, ensuring up-to-date information. Key interactive features include:

*   **Locking:** Persistently "lock" favorite Pok√©mon, which are then displayed in a separate, dedicated section and excluded from subsequent random generations. Locked Pok√©mon cards are displayed in a more compact format.
*   **Sorting:** Sort the *newly generated* Pok√©mon list by Pok√©dex ID, Name (alphabetical), or primary Type. Random sorting is also available.
*   **Shiny Toggle:** Click on any Pok√©mon's image to instantly toggle between its normal and shiny artwork (if available).
*   **External Links:** Click on a Pok√©mon's name or Pok√©dex number to view its detailed page on [Pok√©mon Database](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/).

The interface is designed to be modern, intuitive, and responsive, working well on both desktop and mobile devices. It includes user experience enhancements like a dark mode toggle, language selection (German and English), lazy loading for images, sticky navigation elements for easy access on long pages, and a "scroll to top" button.

## Development Notes

*   This project's code, including feature implementation and refinements, was developed iteratively with the assistance of **Gemini**, a large language model from Google, based on user prompts and requirements.
*   Focus was placed on using vanilla JavaScript for core functionality.
*   Browser caching is relied upon for Pok√©mon sprites and type icons; no complex manual image caching is implemented.
*   `localStorage` is used for persisting Dark Mode preference, Language preference, and the list of Locked Pok√©mon IDs.
