## Project Description

This project is a feature-rich, web-based Pok√©mon Generator designed for fans and developers alike. It allows users to explore the world of Pok√©mon by generating customized lists based on a variety of criteria, including:

*   **Generation:** Select specific Pok√©mon generations (1-9).
*   **Type:** Filter by one or more of the 18 Pok√©mon types.
*   **Evolution:** Filter by position in the evolution chain (Basic, Stage 1, Stage 2) and the total length of the chain (1, 2, or 3 stages).
*   **Special Categories:** Include or exclude Legendary, Mythical, Mega, and Alolan Pok√©mon forms.
*   **Base Stat Total (BST):** Filter Pok√©mon within a specific BST range.

The application fetches Pok√©mon data and images dynamically from the PokeAPI, ensuring up-to-date information. Key interactive features include:

*   **Team Builder:** Select up to 6 Pok√©mon to form a team. The team is displayed in a dedicated section, persists across sessions, and includes both a simple and detailed type-effectiveness analysis (Weaknesses & Resistances).
*   **Locking:** Persistently "lock" favorite Pok√©mon. Locked Pok√©mon are displayed separately in a compact format and excluded from subsequent random generations.
*   **Sorting:** Sort the *newly generated* Pok√©mon list by Pok√©dex ID, Name, primary Type, Base Stat Total (BST), Shiny status, Legendary, Mythical, Mega, Alolan, or shuffle randomly.
*   **Shiny Toggle:** Click on any Pok√©mon's image to instantly toggle between its normal and shiny artwork (if available).
*   **Name Filtering:** Quickly filter the *currently generated* list by Pok√©mon name (English or German).
*   **External Links:** Click on a Pok√©mon's name or Pok√©dex number to view its detailed page on [Pok√©Wiki (German)](https://www.pokewiki.de/).

The interface is designed to be modern, intuitive, and responsive, working well on both desktop and mobile devices. It includes user experience enhancements like a dark mode toggle, language selection (German and English), lazy loading for images, sticky navigation elements, a "scroll to top" button, and persistent user preferences (filters, locked Pok√©mon, team, language, theme).

## How to Use

1.  **Access the App:**
    *   Visit the live demo: **[Pok√©mon Generator](https://cschaf.github.io/pokemon-generator/index.html)**
    *   *Alternatively:* Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/CSchaf/pokemon-generator.git`), navigate into the directory, and open `index.html` locally in your browser (or serve it using a simple local server).
2.  **Set Filters:**
    *   Use the input field to specify the **Number of new Pok√©mon to generate**.
    *   Expand the collapsible filter sections (Generation, Types, Evolution, Special, BST).
    *   Check/uncheck boxes and enter BST values to define criteria. Use the "Select/Deselect All" icons (<i class="fa-solid fa-square-check"></i> / <i class="fa-solid fa-square-minus"></i>) for convenience. Filters persist.
3.  **Generate:** Click the main "Generate Pok√©mon!" button (or the sticky one that appears top-right when scrolling).
4.  **View Results:**
    *   **Locked Pok√©mon** (if any) appear first in a compact section.
    *   **Current Team** (if any) is displayed next, with compact cards and type analysis below. Click the analysis toggle button for the detailed table view.
    *   **Newly Generated Pok√©mon** appear below the team section, sorted by the current criteria (default: ID).
    *   Use the **Name Filter** input (appears above generated results) to quickly search within the generated list.
5.  **Interact with Cards:**
    *   Click a Pok√©mon's image to toggle its **Shiny** form.
    *   Click the **Pok√©dex number or name** to open its Pok√©Wiki page in a new tab.
    *   Click the **lock/unlock icon** (<i class="fa-solid fa-unlock"></i> / <i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> top-left) on generated or locked cards to manage the persistent Locked list.
    *   Click the **plus/minus icon** (<i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i> / <i class="fa-solid fa-minus"></i> bottom-right) on generated or locked cards to manage your Team.
    *   Click the **'X' icon** (<i class="fa-solid fa-times-circle"></i> top-right) on cards *within the Team section* to remove them directly.
6.  **Sort Results:** When scrolled down, use the sorting icons (next to the sticky Generate button) to re-order the *newly generated* Pok√©mon list. Click an icon to sort by that criteria (ascending/default), click again to reverse the order (descending, indicated by <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-short-wide"></i> / <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down-wide-short"></i>). Random (<i class="fa-solid fa-shuffle"></i>) only shuffles.

## Development Notes

*   This project's code, including feature implementation and refinements, was developed iteratively with the assistance of **Gemini**, a large language model from Google, based on user prompts and requirements.
*   Focus was placed on using vanilla JavaScript for core functionality.
*   `localStorage` is used for persisting:
    *   Dark Mode preference (`darkMode`)
    *   Language preference (`language`)
    *   List of Locked Pok√©mon IDs (`lockedPokemonIds_v1`)
    *   Selected filter states (`pokemonGeneratorFilterState_v1`)
    *   Current team member IDs (`pokemonTeamMembers_v1`)
    *   List of Pok√©mon IDs displayed as Shiny (`shinyPokemonIds_v1`)
    *   The main Pok√©mon data cache (`pokemonGeneratorCache_v5`) - *Note: Cache key version may increment.*
*   The application includes validation for cached data and will attempt to refresh from the API if the cache seems incomplete or outdated.
