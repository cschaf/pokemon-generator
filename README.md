## Project Description

This project is a feature-rich, web-based Pok√©mon Generator designed for fans and developers alike. It allows users to explore the world of Pok√©mon by generating customized lists based on a variety of criteria, including:

*   **Generation:** Select specific Pok√©mon generations (1-9).
*   **Type:** Filter by one or more of the 18 Pok√©mon types.
*   **Evolution:** Filter by position in the evolution chain (Basic, Stage 1, Stage 2) and the total length of the chain (1, 2, or 3 stages).
*   **Special Categories:** Include or exclude Legendary and Mythical Pok√©mon.

The application fetches Pok√©mon data and images dynamically from the PokeAPI, ensuring up-to-date information. Key interactive features include:

*   **Team Builder:** Select up to 6 Pok√©mon to form a team. The team is displayed in a dedicated section, persists across sessions, and includes a basic type-weakness/resistance analysis.
*   **Locking:** Persistently "lock" favorite Pok√©mon, which are then displayed in a separate, dedicated section and excluded from subsequent random generations. Locked Pok√©mon cards are displayed in a more compact format.
*   **Sorting:** Sort the *newly generated* Pok√©mon list by Pok√©dex ID, Name (alphabetical), or primary Type. Random sorting is also available.
*   **Shiny Toggle:** Click on any Pok√©mon's image to instantly toggle between its normal and shiny artwork (if available).
*   **External Links:** Click on a Pok√©mon's name or Pok√©dex number to view its detailed page on [Pok√©mon Database](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/).

The interface is designed to be modern, intuitive, and responsive, working well on both desktop and mobile devices. It includes user experience enhancements like a dark mode toggle, language selection (German and English), lazy loading for images, sticky navigation elements for easy access on long pages, a "scroll to top" button, and persistent filter settings.
